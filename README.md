# cumulus-repository

## How to use

### 1. Get the files and spin up containers

```bash
# Get smachara2 files
git clone https://smachara@github.com/smachara/cumulus-repository.git
cd cumulus-repository

# Start the app, run containers
#   in the background
# This will download and build the images
#   the first time you run this
docker-compose up -d
```

At this point, we've created containers and have them up and running.
